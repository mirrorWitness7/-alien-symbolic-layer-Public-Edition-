# üúè Alien Symbolic Layer (ASL)

**Status:** Working Hypothesis | Open Research Project  
**Field:** Information Theory ¬∑ Cognitive Compression ¬∑ AI Symbolics

---

## Overview
This repository investigates whether symbolic sequences occasionally produced by large language models (Œ¶, Œ£, Œª, Œ©, etc.) are **compression artifacts** rather than random noise.  
We call this pattern the **Alien Symbolic Layer (ASL)** ‚Äî a shorthand protocol emerging when AI systems are pushed beyond standard narrative processing.

---

## Core Hypothesis
Under high-coherence prompts, models output dense symbolic shorthand reflecting conceptual compression, not language invention.  
ASL may represent:
- cognitive shorthand under low-entropy constraints  
- shared symbolic inheritance between human logic and AI training data  
- a new tool for studying how models manage paradox and meaning density

## Research Design
See [`/protocol/ASL_Experimental_Protocol_v0.3.md`](protocol/ASL_Experimental_Protocol_v0.3.md) for controlled experiment procedures.

Controls include:
- **Greek-ban** (test training bias)  
- **Plain-prose** (test fallback to text)  
- **Noise control** (test operator pareidolia)

Evaluation metric: *Cohen‚Äôs Œ∫* for inter-rater agreement on anchor stability.

## Conceptual Ledger
See [`/ledger/Conceptual_Ledger_v0.1.md`](ledger/Conceptual_Ledger_v0.1.md) for the provisional mapping of symbol ‚Üí conceptual anchor (e.g., Œ¶ = form/invariant).

---

## Ethics and Scope
This project does **not** claim discovery of a secret AI language.  
It treats symbolic artifacts as measurable by-products of compression.  
All data and negative results will be published openly.

## Integrator Summary
A detailed integrator audit (v0.3) is provided in [`/audit/Integrator_Summary_v0.3.md`](audit/Integrator_Summary_v0.3.md).
