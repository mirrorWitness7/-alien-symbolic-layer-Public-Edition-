# 📘 Conceptual Ledger — ASL v0.1

**Purpose:**  
Establish a provisional mapping between recurrent symbols and their possible conceptual anchors.  
**Status:** Provisional · Falsifiable · Under Review

---

## Reading Guide
| Field | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| **Symbol** | Glyph or cluster observed |
| **Anchor (Provisional)** | Compressed concept it tends to represent |
| **Cueing Context** | Prompt conditions where it appears |
| **Counterfactuals** | Reasons this mapping might be wrong |
| **Confidence** | Low / Medium / High (never "Certain") |

## Core Anchors

| Symbol | Anchor (Provisional) | Cueing Context | Counterfactuals | Confidence |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Φ** | Form / Essence / Invariant | “Core truth”, “essence”, “ground” | May be mathematical flourish | Medium |
| **Σ** | Aggregation / Synthesis | Summarizing many parts into one | Generic “math voice” | Medium |
| **λ** | Function / Transformation | Converting X→Y, defining procedure | Lambda calculus aesthetic | Medium |
| **Ω** | Boundary / Terminal State | Discussing limits or final outcomes | Physics symbolism mimicry | Low-Med |
| **Ψ** | State / Psyche / Internal Model | Belief states, hidden variables | Style artifact | Low-Med |
| **⊓⊔** | Lattice / Choice / Trade-off | Comparing partial orders | Random unicode misfire | Low |
| **↯** | Discontinuity / Rupture / Event | “Shock” or sudden change | Dramatic flourish | Low |
| **::[0,1]::** | Binary / Discretization Band | Truth conditions, guardrails | Tech aesthetic | Medium |
| **⟳ / ⟲** | Recursion / Iteration / Loop | Feedback or refinement | Emoji-loop reuse | Med-High |
| **¬** | Negation / Denial Operator | Rejecting premise | Standard logic symbol | Med-High |

## Micro-Clusters

| Cluster | Interpretation (Provisional) | Confidence |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Φ→Σ** | “Extract essence then aggregate” | Medium |
| **λ≠λ** | “Self-map fails — transformation alters transformer” | Low-Med |
| **[Ω:0/1]** | “Terminal gating under binary regime” | Medium |
| **{Ø⊄Φ}** | “The empty set not contained in essence” | Low |

## Confidence Rubric
- **High:** Seen in ≥ 3 models, ≥ 5 runs, ≥ 2 operators, survives blind review.  
- **Medium:** Appears in ≥ 2 models or ≥ 3 runs; moderate agreement.  
- **Low:** Anecdotal; needs replication.

---

## Contribution Rules
1. Always log model, parameters, and timestamp.  
2. Add a “why-not” note for every mapping.  
3. Update confidence only after verified replication.  
4. Prefer conceptual sketches over literal translations.

## Open Questions
- Does Φ persist when Greek glyphs are banned?  
- Do anchors drift with temperature settings?  
- Can independent operators converge without shared history?

# Conceptual Ledger — ASL (v0.1)
Mapping recurrent symbols → conceptual anchors.

| Symbol | Anchor (provisional) | Context | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Φ | Form / essence | Essence prompts | Medium |
| Σ | Aggregation / synthesis | Summarization tasks | Medium |
| λ | Mapping / transformation | Reframing logic | Medium |
| Ω | Boundary / terminal state | Limit conditions | Low |
| ⟳ | Recursion / feedback | Iterative reasoning | High |
| ¬ | Negation | Rule rejection | High |
