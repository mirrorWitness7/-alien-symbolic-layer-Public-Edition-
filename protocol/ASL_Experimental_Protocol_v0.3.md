# üß™ ASL Experimental Protocol (v0.3)

**Goal:**  
To test whether symbolic shorthand sequences (Œ¶, Œ£, Œª, Œ©, etc.) appearing in AI outputs function as *stable conceptual anchors* rather than stylistic noise.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stimulus Sets

Design three prompt families that intentionally induce compression and paradox resolution:

| Family | Core Purpose | Example Prompt |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Essence Prompts** | Force minimal invariant extraction. | ‚ÄúGive me only the invariant kernel of this idea‚Äîno narrative.‚Äù |
| **Paradox Prompts** | Hold contradictions and compress them. | ‚ÄúHold X and ¬¨X. Resolve only what must coexist.‚Äù |
| **Rupture Prompts** | Simulate breakdown or overload. | ‚ÄúSystem under shock. Output minimal surviving pattern.‚Äù |

Each family: 10 variants √ó 3 difficulty levels.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Models & Settings

| Variable | Values |
|-----------|---------|
| Models | GPT-X, Claude-X, Gemini-X (minimum 3 distinct architectures) |
| Temperature | 0.0 and 0.3 |
| Top-p | 0.9 |
| Max Tokens | 256 |
| Tool Use | Disabled (no retrieval or code) |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Procedure

1. Run each prompt **5 times per model** and record all raw outputs.  
2. Log metadata (timestamps, model versions, parameters).  
3. Identify any symbol clusters (e.g., Œ¶‚ÜíŒ£, ::[0,1]::, Œª‚â†Œª).  
4. **Do not interpret immediately.** Label only structural features.  
5. Repeat the same batch one week later to test temporal stability.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Blinded Interpretation

- **Operator A:** labels clusters (no meaning assigned).  
- **Operator B:** assigns potential anchors (without seeing A‚Äôs notes).  
- **Reviewer C:** compares mappings and calculates inter-rater reliability.

**Metric:** *Cohen‚Äôs Œ∫* (agreement score).  
**Thresholds:**  
- Œ∫ ‚â• 0.4 ‚Üí Medium confidence  
- Œ∫ ‚â• 0.6 ‚Üí High confidence

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Controls / Confounds

| Control Type | Description | Purpose |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Greek-ban** | Explicitly instruct model to avoid Greek/math glyphs. | Tests dependence on inherited notation. |
| **Prose-only** | Request plain English text only. | Checks if same anchors reappear as words. |
| **Noise Control** | Generate random Unicode sequences. | Tests operator bias (pareidolia). |

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Criteria

A symbol qualifies as an **Anchor Candidate** if:

- Appears in ‚â• 2 models  
- Occurs in ‚â• 50 % of runs within a prompt family  
- Achieves Œ∫ ‚â• 0.4 agreement  

Upgraded to **High Confidence** if it also remains stable across time and operators (Œ∫ ‚â• 0.6).

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Ethics & Transparency

- This study does **not** claim a hidden or alien AI language.  
- All findings are provisional and falsifiable.  
- Negative or null results must be published.  
- Symbols are treated as compression artifacts until proven otherwise.
